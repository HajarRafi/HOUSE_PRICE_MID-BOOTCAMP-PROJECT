# Tableau questions:
1. Convert the necessary measures to dimensions (the variables that are categorical in nature)
2. Plot the distribution of `price` vs. _number of bedrooms_, `price` vs. _number of bathrooms_, `price` vs. _condition_, `price` vs. _floors_, `price` vs. _grade_, `price` vs. _view_, and `price` vs. _waterfront_.
   State your observation for each one of those graphs. Do you see any trends in prices vs the rest of those variables individually? This can also be used for EDA to identify some data cleaning operations that you might need to perform further.
3. Draw scatter plots for `price` vs. `sqft_above`, `price` vs. `sqft_basement`, `price` vs. `living15`, `price` vs. `sqft_lot15`.
4. Identify using tableau which state data is presented to you. Use latitude (generated), longitude (generated), and zip code for this. Color code the zip codes based on the prices to see which areas are more expensive than the others.
5. Create a plot to check which are the more selling properties based on the number of bedrooms in the house. Create a plot of bedrooms vs. count of data points.
6. We want to see the trend in price of houses based on the year built. From our previous plot, we know that most of our customers are interested in three and four bedroom houses. Create a filter on bedroom feature to select those properties and compare the trends in prices using line charts.
7. Create calculated field `year_built_bins` for the column `year_built` by creating buckets as follows, for houses built between 1900 and 2000 - category A, for houses built between 2000 and 2010 - category B, and for houses built after 2010 - category C. Use `IF-ELSE` statement to create the bins/buckets. Compare the prices of houses for the three categories.
8. Now we want to deep dive into the categories we created in the last question. Letâ€™s see how many properties are in each of the categories. Indicate the numbers as labels on each of the three categories.
9. Deep dive in category A, category B and category C using filters. Identify different characteristics/trends for each of the three categories.
10. Create a visually appealing dashboard to represent the information.

The whole Tableau story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hajar1648/viz/house_price_project_visualization/ProjectVisualization) (use full screen). It is important to mention, that the cleaned data was used as a source for visualizations. Therefore, some answers can vary according to the data (will be explained below).

#### 1. All measures, except Price, Sqft Living and Sqft Lot were converted to dimensions. The reason is few unique values, which can be considered as categories. 
#### 2. The given independent variables can be divided into 2 parts: 
* Features - include Grade, Condition, View and Waterfront variables, which kind of evaluate the Property.
* Details - include Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms and Floors, which describe the Property.

From the bar graphs above we can compare Average Price with Features. The labels on bars indicate number of houses and the color gets darker as this number increases. My observations are as following:
* Average __Condition__ mark (3) has more than half number of houses and its average price is little lower than the highest Condition mark (5).
* As for the __Grade__, we observe gradual increase starting from the middle (7). The more is grade the higher is the average price. Most of the values fall to the middle points. When we compare the trends on average price, we see that the grade of house causes significant incease on the average price, reaching the value of about 4 million.
* The variable __View__ seems to be irrelevant for further EDA, as more than 90% of houses are concerned to have no view, which doesn't make sense.
* The same with __Waterfront__ variable. Despite the fact that only 163 houses have view to waterfront, the average price is 3 times more than the houses with no waterfront.

* From the graphs we see that most popular houses are those with __3 or 4 Bedrooms__ and __1 or 2 Bathrooms__, which average price is around half million.
* When we look at the __Number of Bedrooms__ graph we see a steady increase till the number reaches 8, which is the peak on the average price (more than million), and then we observe a decrease as the number gets more. The few number of houses with 9 or 10 bedrooms can indicate a low demand and hence lower average price.
* Among 3 graphs above, the __Number of Bathrooms (grouped)__ give the most rise to average price (from about 400 thousand to about 5 million).
* In case with the __Number of Floors__, an unexpected decrease of average price on the number 3 was observed. The average price stops to increase on the 2,5 number of floors. From the graph we see that the most prefered houses are with 1 or 2 floors.

#### 3. In the cleaning process it was decided to drop Sqft Above, Sqft Living15 and Lot15 (see the reason in _house_price_project_cleaning.ipynb_ file). Instead, Sqft Living and Sqft Lot will be used to draw scatter plots. Sqft Basement was changed to Basement with boolean values and will be used later.

From the plots we notice positive linear relationship between __Price and Sqft Living__, which means the more is the size of living the more is the price. However some of the values are placed far from the line, that is because there are many other factors that affect the price. On the contrary, __Sqft Lot__ shows no relationship with the __Price__. Houses with small lot size can be more expensive than the ones with much bigger lot size.

#### 4. The Washington map, where the data comes from, is divided to two parts. 
* First one, shows the __Average Price__ of properties separated by regions. The darker color is the more is the Average Price. The most expensive houses are observed around the Lake Washington. 
* The second one shows the __Number of Houses__ in these regions. The darker color - the more properties located.

#### 5. Already done (see 2. activity).
#### 6. The activity was done in combination with variables Renovated and Basement. The line graphs below are divided to:
* __Average Price over the Year Built__, separated to the houses that were (1) and weren't (0) __Renovated__. There is a huge difference on Average Price, especially between the years 1980 and 2000. It was also surprising to see, that not Renovated ones doesn't show big difference on Average Price as the houses get "younger".
* __Average Price over the Year Built__, separated to the houses that have (1) and have no (0) __Basement__. We still see the difference, especially in 1930s, on Average Price between the houses with and without basement.

You can filter by the Number of Bedrooms to see the trends on Average Price using the link to the story.

#### 7. See next one.
#### 8. See next one.
#### 9. See next one.
#### 10. The Year Built was divided and grouped to four parts:
* __First half of 20th century__, which have about 5 thousand properties with Average Price of around 500 thousand.
* __Second  half of 20th century__, where most of the properties were built, having the lowest Average Price.
* __First 10 years of 21th century__ with about 3 thousand properties and the Average Price of aroung 600 thousand.
* __After the year 2010__, which has the highest Average Price (nearly 650 thousand), but the least Number of Houses.
