# HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT
This mid bootcamp project is about the houses of Washington sold in 2014-2015. 

The objective is to answer some business questions and build the regression model on price prediction. 

For this purpose, such tools as Mysql, Tableau Public and Jupyter notebook were used.

The repository includes:

### 1. The dataset (excel file)
The dataset includes a list of about 22000 properties with their features. For the file refer to [regression_data.xls](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/blob/main/).

### 2. The cleaned dataset
This excel file [cleaned_data.xls](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/blob/main/cleaned_data.xls) is a result of cleaning and filtering data for analysis and regression. The columns, remained after data wrangling, with their meanings are on the image below.

### 3. "Python" folder
The folder, in its turn, includes 2 Jupyter notebook files:
 * File [house_price_project_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/blob/main/Python/house_price_project_cleaning.ipynb) is about acquaintance with data and the process of cleaning.
 * File [house_price_project_eda_modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/blob/main/Python/house_price_project_eda_modeling.ipynb) explores the data, builds models to predict the target and evaluates the results.

### 4. "SQL" folder

[Here](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/tree/main/SQL) you can find sql_queries_project.sql file, which answers some business questions, using Mysql. Some outputs of queries are saved as images in the folder.

### 5. "Tableau" folder

[The folder](https://github.com/HajarRafi/HOUSE_PRICE_MID-BOOTCAMP-PROJECT/tree/main/Tableau) contains:
* Extended answers to the given questions, using visualizations on Tableau, and the description of graphs (README.md file)
